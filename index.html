        <h3> 
            Before I started this course, I was a very beginner at coding -- I have tried some CSS before, but I never thought of doing javascript for myself. Javascript seems so hard and complicated, that was why I was worried when I start this assignment.
<br><br>
The first step was simple; just following what professor Maduekwe showed. When I found that my code actually works and I could draw a fancy pattern (it was cooler than expected for a beginner!), I got some confidence and willing to find out more.
<br><br>
For the entire journey of drawing, there were so many challenges. I searched over p5 references, websites and youtube videos. Just a single typo blocked my code from working. But the most challenge I faced was testing a variety of skills from different libraries to develop my work day by day, and implementing my plan into actual coding with understanding my limit. I had to keep trying new content with more complexity. Making the letter 'N' I chose while using those new skills forced me to push my limit. 
<br><br>
Even if I am not 100% satisfied with my results, I know this experience -- adjusting my plan to my ability, and basic training for coding -- gave me a great opportunity to be a better designer. I was able to nail it, and I believe it would support me to try anything new for my own development.
